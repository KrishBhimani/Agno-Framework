      "Hello Krish! How can I assist you with your tasks today? Do you need help with the development of the Fundraising and Governance Contracts, or you require support for setting up your Supabase project? Please provide me with clear details to ensure I can offer the most relevant help.\n",
      "Sure, based on the information you previously provided, here is the plan for week 5:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Krish will be setting up a Supabase project. \n",
      "\n",
      "Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. He will specifically be dealing with the setup and initial configurations of this project. This might involve creating a new database, setting up authentication and rules, and planning the data structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Furthermore, based on prior information, Krish will also be creating the following tables in Supabase:\n",
      "  1. Users\n",
      "  2. Projects\n",
      "  3. Milestones\n",
      "  4. Investments \n",
      "\n",
      "Frontend calls to Supabase will be utilized for reading and writing project data and user profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems to be the highlight of his plans for week 5. It might help Krish to start getting familiar with Supabase and its documentation, if he hasn't done so already, to ensure a smooth setup process.\n",
      "Sure, here's a summary of Krish's planned activities for Week 6 based on the information you've provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Governance Contract Development**: Krish is scheduled to work on a Governance Contract. The contract is planned to have a proposal lifecycle which will allow for voting on projects or milestones. It will also include roles for admin setup. The governance model will be primarily based on Akres token weighting or Council NFT gating.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fundraising Contract Development**: Alongside the Governance Contract, Krish also plans to work on a Fundraising Contract. This contract is designed to emit events for state changes. The funds will be held in escrow and will only be released upon governance approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the Governance Contract and the Fundraising Contract will be a major focus for Krish in Week 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that Week 5 was scheduled for setting up a Supabase project with tables including Users, Projects, Milestones, Investments. Make sure this is prepared before moving on to week 6 activities as they seem to be interdependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a packed week, so it might be a good idea to plan every day of the week meticulously and set achievable targets to ensure all tasks are completed within time.\n",
      "Sure, based on the memory you provided, it seems that Krish's plan for week 1 includes a thorough understanding of the project's scope and preparing the technical groundwork for the product. Here's an overview of his week:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Week 1 Action Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Finalize MVP Scope & User Flows:**\n",
      "   - Confirm user interactions: Krish will define the workings of the decentralized application (dApp), considering the perspectives of different user types - Investors, Developers, and Council.\n",
      "   - Milestone release flow: Krish will establish the flow for releasing milestones, such as the number of milestones and who will authorize them.\n",
      "   - Clarify governance requirements: Any roles or NFTs required for governance will be clarified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Technical Prep:**\n",
      "   - Select EVM chain: Krish is considering deploying the contracts on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain such as Polygon, Ethereum, or Avax.\n",
      "   - Draft Supabase schema: Krish will draft a Supabase schema for project metadata including tables for Projects, Milestones, Users, which he plans to implement later on when setting up the Supabase project.\n",
      "   - Use XO prompts: Krish will define how prompts in XO will be used to generate front-end components.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan seems to set a strong foundation for Krish's upcoming tasks. It's a perfect combination of strategy and technical planning that will aid in the smooth development of the Governance Contract, Fundraising Contract, Supabase Auth configuration, and table creation in the following weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else you need help with!\n",
      "Thank you for providing me with the information. \n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like ~~Krish~~ is working on an interesting project, Akreage and the CEO is Matt Bright. Please let me know if you have any specific tasks related to this project that Krish needs help with, like managing the project's metadata in Supabase, drafting a schema for it, or any actions related to the Governance Contract and voting mechanism. \n",
      "\n",
      "Krish has a busy schedule planned out, with the setting up of a Supabase project in week 5, developing a Governance Contract in week 6, and various tasks related to project proposals, milestone approvals, and user profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the more I learn about Krish's preferences, needs and the context of the project he's working on, the better I can assist him. So don't hesitate to update me with more information about Krish's plans and activities. Also, since Krish is working on a project involving a voting mechanism, I can provide assistance in understanding or analyzing voting data, if required. Let me know how else I can assist.\n",
      "Sure, here's the list of Krish's plans for weeks 1, 5, and 6:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Week 1:**\n",
      "- Finalize the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scope & User Flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Week 5:**\n",
      "- Set up a Supabase project. \n",
      "- Create Supabase tables: Users, Projects, Milestones, Investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Week 6:**\n",
      "- Develop a Fundraising Contract.\n",
      "- Develop a Governance Contract.\n",
      "- Include a proposal lifecycle for voting on project proposals or milestone approvals in the Governance Contract.\n",
      "- Define the exact milestone release flow (how many milestones, who authorizes them). \n",
      "- Include milestone triggers for fund release upon governance approval in the Fundraising Contract.\n",
      "- Plan for the Fundraising Contract to emit events for state changes.\n",
      "- Include escrow logic in the Fundraising Contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, proper planning is the key to success. Good luck with your projects, Krish!\n",
